'data' contains small simulated datasets (haploid/diploid/microsatellite data)
'examples' contains scripts to estimate effective migration rates for the simulated data
'mscripts' contains the implementation in MATLAB/OCTAVE
'rscripts' contains plotting scripts in R

####################

The examples show how to run MCMC_haploid, MCMC_diploid, MCMC_microsat
(the MCMC inference for effective migration rates for three types of genetic data)

####################

To visualize the results, you can use the scripts in 'rscripts'.
These use the 'fields' and 'deldir' R packages, so they should be installed first.

* plot-posterior-mean.R:
  visualizes the posterior mean migration surface
* plot-posterior-mean.R:
  draws samples from the posterior migration distribution
* plot-posterior-rdist.R
  scatterplot of fitted vs observed distances between demes (locations)
* merge-posterior-means.R :
  averages the surfaces from several realizations of the Markov chain
