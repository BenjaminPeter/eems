# EEMS: Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces


* `bed2diffs` contains a small program that reads genotypes in Plink binary format and computes the matrix of average pairwise differences, to pass to EEMS
* `examples` shows how to run EEMS using data simulated with `ms`
* `mscripts` contains the source code for MATLAB/OCTAVE
* `rscripts` contains scripts to visualize EEMS results
