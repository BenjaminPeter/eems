# EEMS: Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces


This is an EEMS implemntation for MATLAB or Octave. It is much less efficient than the C++ version.


* `examples` shows how to run EEMS using data simulated with `ms`
* `mscripts` contains the source code for MATLAB/OCTAVE
* `rscripts` contains scripts to visualize EEMS results
