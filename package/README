## 'data' contains small simulated datasets (haploid/diploid/microsatellite data)
## 'examples' contains scripts to estimate effective migration rates for the simulated data
## 'mscripts' contains the implementation in MATLAB/OCTAVE
## 'rscripts' contains plotting scripts in R


## Please see the examples which show how to run MCMC_haploid, MCMC_diploid, MCMC_microsats
## (the MCMC inference for effective migration rates for three types of genetic data)
